MStar MSC313E SoC breakout

Rough layout. Minimal decoupling caps because of limited space. Test to see if two layers works.
May move to some 0402 passives if not.

## bugs

Pinout foobar. USB ground isn't wired up because of a difference in the pin number of the symbol
and the footprint. Fixed by shorting the id pin to ground next to it.
